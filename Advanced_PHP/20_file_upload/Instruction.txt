Configure The "php.ini" File

First, ensure that PHP is configured to allow file uploads.

In your "php.ini" file, search for the file_uploads directive, and set it to On:
  
    file_uploads = On




Some rules to follow for the HTML form above:

   1. Make sure that the form uses method="post"
   2. The form also needs the following   attribute: enctype="multipart/form-data". 
             "It specifies which content-type to use when submitting the form
               Without the requirements above, the file upload will not work."

Other things to notice:

      The type="file" attribute of the <input> tag shows the input field as a file-select control, 
with a "Browse" button next to the input control
